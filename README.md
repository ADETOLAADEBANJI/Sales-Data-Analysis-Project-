# Sales Data Analysis Project


### Project Description

The primary goal of this undertaking is to comprehensively investigate the provided dataset and furnish well-informed responses, driven by data, to make the right decisions in order to boost sales.
In this project I use Excel to perform an exploratory analysis on a year of monthly sales reports. After cleaning the data, I built pivot tables to visualize the data and build dashboard of charts from the pivot tables. The power of data analysis in the realm of sales is well-established, as it enables the derivation of essential information, thereby fostering more informed and streamlined decision-making practices.
The Sales Data Analysis Dashboard project using Excel is designed to provide insights into key metrics and trends sales in a company. The dashboard utilizes visualizations and data analysis techniques to help sales professionals identify patterns and make data-driven decisions. The dashboard includes several key visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of sales by category, productwise sales, monthly sales, sales by sales Rep, sales by city, product by category and unit sold.
The dashboard also includes interactive features that allow users to filter and drill down into specific data sets, such as sales Rep, city or month. This provides sales professionals with a more detailed view of their data, allowing them to identify patterns and trends more easily.


### Sales Analysis

In this project, I used a sample of a company's monthly sales dataset for 1 year (January 2021 - December 2021) in a microsoft(.xlxs) file which contain Date, product name, Category, Sales Rep, City, No of Units, Price and Amount. I analyze and visualize the data based on basic requirements.

### Reconmendations

- Personalized interactions and recognition of loyal customers can build long-term relationships and repeat business. For VIP customers, we can offer exclusive, tailored events and initiatives to increase satisfaction and loyalty. For less engaged customers, targeted campaigns based on their needs and preferences can reinvigorate interest in our brand.

- We should prioritize marketing in Mumbai, Hyderabad,Delhi and Bengadore. Concentrating on these targeted markets can improve efficiency and pursue the most promising opportunities. This focused approach can enhance overall business performance.

- Advertisements and more incentives is also advised to be done quarterly and at the end of the year.Sales booster should be encouraged more in Cochin because the city has the lowest sales unit and it generates the lowest Amount.

- Seminars and Training can be organized for all the sales Rep for them to interact and learn from each other.
